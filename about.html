  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am currently finishing my PhD at Columbia University, where my work focuses on the structure and function of biomolecules.
    Broadly, this field seeks to connect the physical realities of large, flexible molecules—how they fold, move, and interact—with the biological roles they ultimately perform.
    Understanding this relationship is central to explaining how molecular systems function reliably, and how they sometimes fail.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current research centers on oligomerization: the process by which biomolecules bind to one or more copies of themselves.
    I am interested in how this seemingly simple interaction can give rise to emergent biological behaviors that are not apparent at the level of individual molecules.
    This paradigm has important implications for fundamental biological processes as well as for understanding disease mechanisms and translational applications.

<!-- I first came to this field about 10 years ago because of this very fact: you don't just have to guess at how a molecule executes and newly-described biological function – you can go observe it yourself. While, this claim wildly diminishes the scale of technical knowledge, work, and ambiguity that goes into 'observing' a biomolecule, the spirit of the claim remains: a type of faith that if you ask the right type of question, you can come closer to understanding the determinants of outcomes. The training that goes in to this type of work is multifaceted. From biological assays, to quantum mechanics, to computational chemistry – even minor excursions in electrical engineering and computer science – working in this field requires you to be flexible with the applications of your knowledge. -->
